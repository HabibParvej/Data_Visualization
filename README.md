# Marketing Data Analysis

This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a marketing dataset. The analysis aims to uncover customer behavior patterns and insights, particularly in relation to education levels, spending habits, and correlations among numerical features.

## Project Overview

Marketing data analysis provides valuable insights for understanding customer demographics and spending patterns. By visualizing and analyzing the dataset, this project highlights important trends that can aid decision-making for targeted marketing strategies.

## Steps in the Analysis

1. **Data Loading and Overview**:
   - Load the marketing dataset (`Marketing.csv`).
   - Display the first few rows of the dataset to get an initial understanding.
   - Perform basic data inspection using `.info()` and `.describe()`.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Identify and handle missing values by dropping rows with null entries.

3. **Visualizations**:
   - **Bar Chart**: Count of customers by education level.
   - **Scatter Plot**: Relationship between income and spending on wine, differentiated by marital status.
   - **Heatmap**: Correlation matrix of numeric features to understand relationships.

4. **Key Insights**:
   - Most customers have a Bachelor's degree or equivalent.
   - Higher-income individuals tend to spend more on wine.
   - Strong positive correlation observed between `Income` and `Total Spending`.

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced and aesthetically pleasing visualizations.

## Usage

To replicate this analysis, ensure you have the required dataset file (`Marketing.csv`) in your working directory and the following Python libraries installed:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Run the script in any Python environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, IDE, or terminal).
